# Predicting-Bulldozers-Price
This is a Regression problem project based on a Kaggle competition aimed at predicting the auction prices of bulldozers using historical data and characteristics. The dataset is extensive and includes a wide range of features related to the bulldozers, such as equipment type, usage, age, and sale date. The primary objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately forecast the sale prices of bulldozers, thus helping buyers and sellers make informed decisions.
